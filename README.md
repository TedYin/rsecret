# Secret

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/secret`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

  conf.aes_mode = Mode::AES_256_CBC # or AES_128_CBC
  conf.hash_mode = Mode::SHA_256 # or MD5
  # If encode_mode is nil ,it will not encode or decode msg
  conf.encode_mode = Mode::BASE_64
  # RSA pem file config
  conf.rsa_pub_key_path = 'Your rsa public pem file path'
  conf.rsa_pri_key_path = 'Your rsa private pem file path'
  conf.rsa_pwd = 'Your rsa private pem password'
